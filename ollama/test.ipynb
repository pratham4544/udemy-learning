Summary\\nBy  Spencer Johnson\\nChange is the only certainty in life, so why do we avoid and even fear it?\\nWe know that change is inevitable, yet we lack effective strategies to\\ncome to terms with it. What if there was a roadmap to help us better\\nnavigate change?\\nWho Moved My Cheese  is a light-hearted fable that offers deep insights into\\nadapting to change in multiple scenarios. In a simple story of the\\ninevitability of change, two mice and two little people navigate living in a\\nmaze and maintaining their cheese supplies. The characters reveal that\\nwe can either accept change, or complain about it.\\nThis summary takes a brief look at Dr. Johnson's story. It tackles the\\ncomplexity of how we react to change, as a means to inspire us to be\\ncourageous in the face of it. Growth often emerges because of adversity,\\nand sometimes unexpected scenarios arise when we least expect them.\\nHowever, these curveballs don't have to be frightening. On the contrary,\\nthey may even offer us incredible joy and opportunity.\\nIs There a Slice of Wisdom in This Story for You?\\nThe story takes place in a maze. Two mice, named Sniff and Scurry, and\\ntwo mouse-sized people, named Hem and Haw, search for cheese. For\\nan idyllic period, the inhabitants are lucky enough to find some cheese at\\nStation C, and enjoy a plentiful supply of their favorite food. As is the\\ninevitable way of the world, the cheese starts to run out.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Who Moved My Cheese_.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content=\"The inhabitants react differently to their changing situation. Sniff and\\nScurry understand that the situation has changed, so they decide to\\nsearch for new cheese. Hem and Haw, however, are less pragmatic. They\\nmoan about the unfairness of the situation and blame others for moving\\ntheir cheese.\\nEven though the cheese is no longer in Station C, Hem and Haw keep\\ngoing back there, hoping that the cheese will reappear. Haw, eventually\\nrealizes that the cheese isn't going to reappear magically. So, he decides\\nto venture out in pursuit of new cheese. Hem, is far less brave and\\nrefuses to leave Station C, but Haw sets out into the unknown, leaving a\\nnote for his friend saying, 'What would you do if you weren't afraid?'\\nHaw, begins his epic journey, and slowly starts to notice small changes\\nwithin himself. The search for something new, actually feels quite\\nexhilarating. This journey makes him self-reflective, and he begins to\\nwrite maxims on the walls of the maze in the hope that one day, Hem\\nmight see them. Eventually, Haw discovers a new station with an\\nabundance of cheese, and he reunites with Sniff and Scurry. They have\\nbeen there for some time, enjoying the fruits of their labor.\\nOne of the book's central messages is that Haw's notes on the wall serve\\nas encouragement for us all. Many of us are like Hem, and may struggle\\nwith the journey of change, taking risks, and venturing forward into the\\nunknown.\\nSo, what are Haw's insights? And how can we apply these insights to our\\nown lives?\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Who Moved My Cheese_.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='They Keep Moving the Cheese\\nReflecting back, Haw realizes that the cheese didn\\'t just disappear. It was\\ndiminishing all along. In this story, cheese is a metaphor for all of the\\nthings that we need in our life. We all have our different \"cheeses\" in life,\\nbe it our health, a great job, or healthy relationships. The problem is that,\\nwe grow accustomed to our cheese. We even believe that we\\'re entitled\\nto it. When something changes, when our cheese is taken or reaches its\\nexpiration date, we react with shock and lament the world and its\\nunfairness. This reaction, only makes our situation worse. We expect\\nthings to change in our favor. If they don\\'t change, we grow increasingly\\ncomplacent, or we experience feelings of suffering.\\nThe Buddhists have a \"two arrow\" analogy for suffering. They say that,\\nany time we suffer misfortune, two arrows fly our way. The first arrow is\\nthe actual bad event, which can indeed cause pain. The second arrow is\\nour reaction to the event - it\\'s often just our negativity towards change.\\nThis second arrow, tends to exacerbate our suffering. Feeling the pain of\\nchange is entirely normal, but we can choose to lessen our suffering.\\nIn the story, Haw realizes Over time that change is inevitable. Accepting\\nchange and acknowledging every situation\\'s impermanence, helps us to\\navert the suffering that comes from clinging to the old, and resisting the\\nnew. \\'This too shall pass,\\' is a saying that holds true for all circumstances.\\nIt\\'s a mindset that can help us savor the good times, and endure the\\ntrying ones. They will always keep moving the cheese, so we always\\nhave to adapt and overcome.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Who Moved My Cheese_.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Get Ready for the Cheese to Move\\nHaw\\'s second lesson is that we always need to gear ourselves up for\\nchange. The two mice kept their running shoes ready, and when they\\nnoticed that the cheese was diminishing, they moved on in search of new\\ncheese. Hem and Haw didn\\'t anticipate or act quickly in response to their\\n\"cheeseless\" situation, leaving them less equipped to handle it.\\nBeing able to sniff out change (detect it) and scurry (take action) helps us\\nkeep one step ahead. In Pippa Malmgren\\'s book, Signals, the economist\\nargues that we can\\'t predict how things will turn out. But, we can be\\nbetter prepared. As the saying goes, \"forewarned is forearmed.\" We all\\nneed to be alert to everyday signals so that we can navigate the world\\naround us.\\nSmell the Cheese Often, so You Know When itâ€™s\\nGetting Old\\nComplacency makes us lose focus. Sniff and Scurry were able to find\\nnew cheese, a long time before Hem and Haw. They did this by closely\\nmonitoring the initial cheese scenario. They remained action-focused,\\nrather than becoming caught in over-analysis and stale resentments.'),\n",

What\\naction steps do you need to take in your own life? Perhaps, it's time to\\nlearn a new skill or shift your focus. Maybe, there's a relationship that\\nneeds some rebuilding. Either way, it's vital to trust your instincts and\\nbecome action-orientated in the face of change.\\nThe difficulty is that, like Hem, we tend to resist change, while\\nreminiscing about the way things were. Many of us focus on the past,\\nrather than the present or the future. As Haw's journey progressed, he\\nfound little bits of cheese along the way, which helped him develop a\\ntaste for adventure. He even went back to offer Hem some of this new\\ncheese, but Hem refused. Hem was reluctant to test the unknown.\\nRather than stay with Hem at the old cheese station, Haw realized it was\\nnecessary to continue through the maze. Staying in the same place for\\nfear of the unknown isn't a productive way of living. So, to make room for\\nthe new, we must let go of the old. To quote the author, 'The quicker you\\nlet go of old cheese, the sooner you can enjoy new cheese.'\\nTo settle his fears, Haw would visualize himself sitting on top of a\\nmassive wedge of French Brie: his favorite cheese. This vision enabled\\nhim to focus on future gains, rather than potential losses. Reframing the\\nsituation, motivates him to keep hope alive and continue on his search,\\ndespite disappointments.\\nSuccessful innovators and athletes use the power of visualization to see\\nbeyond their fears, and bring life to new possibilities.

Fear can protect us, but sometimes it can become overprotective.\\nWe all need to be a bit more intuitive and listen for the voice of courage,\\nwhich may ask us, 'What would you do if you weren't afraid?'\\nIt's important to acknowledge our fear and understand that our narrative\\noften doesn't match our reality. While fear can be immobilizing, it can also\\nstop you from embracing new opportunities. So, we all need to focus on\\nthe infinite possibilities.\\nMove With the Cheese\\nHaw's fifth piece of advice is that we all need to be willing to shift, and\\nadapt to change. If we can learn to embrace change, we might realize\\nthat new discoveries, experiences, and achievements, can all outweigh\\ndoing the same comfortable things repeatedly.
